## Requirements
```
numpy
```
If not already installed, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running
python pageRank.py <input_file>

Where <input_file> is the path to a CSV file formatted according to the specifications in the assignment.
NOTE: "football" must be in the filename to correctly read in the NCAA football graph

The program will output:
- Read time (time to parse the input file)
- Number of nodes and edges in the graph
- Processing time (time to compute PageRank)
- Number of iterations until convergence
- The ranked list of nodes with their PageRank scores
