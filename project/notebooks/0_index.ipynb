    "\n",
    "This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of board games to understand what factors contribute to high ratings. The analysis uses principal component analysis, random forest/linear regression, collaborative filtering, and various clustering techniques to identify patterns and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Data Preparation](./1_data_preparation.ipynb): Loading and preprocessing the board game dataset.\n",
    "2. [PCA Analysis](./2_pca_analysis.ipynb): Reducing dimensionality of binary board game features.\n",
    "3. [High Ratings Clustering](./3_high_ratings.ipynb): Analyzing clusters within highly-rated board games (rating >= 7.0).\n",
    "4. [Low Ratings Clustering](./4_low_ratings.ipynb): Analyzing clusters within low-rated board games (rating < 6.0).\n",
    "5. [High vs. Low Clustering Comparison](./5_high_low_comparison.ipynb): Analyzing the differences between high-rated and low-rated board games.\n",
    "6. [Collaborative Filtering](./6_collaborative_filtering.ipynb): Exploration of a collaborative filtering model based on the user_ratings data to recommend games to users and suggest similar games.\n",
    "7. [Predicting Average Rating](./7_predict_average_rating.ipynb): Train a Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict average rating for a game.\n",

    "## How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the notebooks in order to reproduce the analysis. **Some notebooks load data saved by previous notebooks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek/) and all CSV files must be in the `data/` directory at the root of the project directory\n",
    "- Intermediate dataframes and data shared between notebooks are stored in the `frames/` directory\n",
    "- All plots generated in notebooks are stored in the `plots/` directory"
